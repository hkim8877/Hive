Once upon a time 
A tiny striped caterpillar 
Burst from the egg 
Which had been home 
For so long. 

"Hello world/' he said. 

"It sure is bright out here in the sun." 




‘Tm hungry/' he thought 
and straightaway began to eat 
the leaf he was born on. 

And he ate another... and another. ...and another. 
And got bigger...and bigger.... and bigger.... 



Until one day he stopped 
Eating and thought, 

“There must be more to life 
that just eating and 
getting bigger. 

“It’s getting dull." 





So Stripe crawled down 
From the friendly tree 
Which had shaded and 
fed him. 



He was seeking more. 



There were all sorts of new 
things to find. Grass and dirt 
and holes and tiny bugs - 
each fascinated him. 





But nothing satisfied him. 



When he came across some 
other crawlers like himself he 
was especially excited. 

But they were so busy eating 
They had no time to talk - 

Just as Stripe had been. 

"They don't know any more 
about life than I do," he sighed. 




Then one day 
Stripe saw some 
crawlers really 
crawling. 



He looked around for 
their goal 
and saw a great 
column rising high 
into the air. 





When he joined them he discovered.... 



....the column was a pile 
of squirming, pushing 
caterpilalrs - 

a caterpillar pillar. 




It appeared that the 
caterpillars were trying 
to reach the top - 
but the top was so lost in 
the clouds 
that Stripe had no 
idea what was there. 

He felt new excitement - 
like sap rising in the 
spring. 

"Maybe I'll find what 
I'm looking for." 





Full of agitation Stripe asked a 
fellow crawler: 

"Do you know what is happening?" 
"I just arrived myself/' said the 
other. "Nobody has time to 
explain; they're so busy trying to 
get wherever they are going up 
there." 

"But what's at the top?" 
continued Stripe. 

"No one knows that either but it 
must be awfully good because 
everybody's rushing there. 
Goodbye, I've no more time!" 

He plunged into the pile. 



Stripe's head was bursting with 
the new drive. He couldn't get 
his thoughts together. 

Every second another crawler 
passed him and disappeared 
into the pillar. 

"There's only one thing to do." 
He pushed himself in. 




CHAPTER. 2 




The first moments on the 
pile were a shock. 

Stripe was pushed and kicked 
and stepped on 
from every direction. 

It was climb or be climbed.... 



No more fellow caterpillars 
on Stripe's pile - 




They became only threats 
and obstacles which he 
turned into steps and 
opportunities. 

They single-minded approach 
really helped and Stripe 
felt he was getting much 
higher. 

But some days it seemed he 
could manage only to keep his 
place. 

It was especially then that 
an anxious shadow nagged 
inside. "What's at the top?" 
it whispered. 



"Where are we going?" 




On one exasperated day Stripe 
couldn't stand it any longer 
and actually yelled back: 

"I don't know, but there's no time 
to think about it!" 

A little yellow caterpillar he was 
crawling over gasped: 

"I was just talking to 
myself," Stripe mumbled. 

"Its really isn't important - 
I was just wondering 
where we were going?" 




"You know," Yellow said, 

"I was wondering that myself 

but since there is no way to find out I 

decided it wasn’t important." 

She blushed at how silly this sounded - 
quickly adding, "No one else seems to 
worry about where we’re going so it 
must be good." 

But she blushed again. 

"How far are we from the top?" 

Stripe answered gravely, 

"Since we’re not at the bottom and not 
at the top we must be in the middle." 

"Oh," said Yellow, and they both began 
climbing again. 

But now Stripe had a new feeling. 

He felt bad. 

He had lost his singlemindedness. 

"How can I step on someone I’ve just 
talked to?" 




Stripe avoided Yellow as much 
as possible, but one day there 
she was, blocking the only way 
up. 

"Well, I guess it's you or me," 
he said, and stepped squarely 
on her head. 

Something in the way Yellow 
looked at him made him feel 
just awful about himself. 

Like: no matter what is up 
there - it just isn't worth it." 




Stripe crawled off 
Yellow and 
whispered, 

"I'm sorry." 



And Yellow began to cry: 




Q

"I could stand this life hoping in what 
was ahead until I met you talking to 
yourself that day. Since then my 
heart hasn't been in it - but I don't 
know what to do." 

"I didn't know how badly I felt about 
this life until now. Now when you look 
at me so kindly, I know for sure I 
don't like this life. I just want to do 
something like crawl with you and 
nibble grass." 

Stripe's heart leapt inside. 

Everything looked different. 

The pillar made no sense at all. 

"I would like that too," he whispered. 
But this meant giving up the climb - 
a hard decision. 




“Yellow dear, maybe, we're close to 
the top. 

Maybe if we help each other we can 
get there quickly." 

“Maybe," she said. 

But they both knew this wasn’t what 
they wanted most. 

“Let's go down," Yellow said. 

“Okay." And they stopped climbing. 

They clung to each other as masses 
of caterpillars crawled over them. 
The air was terrible but they were 
happy with each other and made a 
big ball so nobody could step in 
their eyes and stomachs. 






They did nothing at 
all for what seemed a 
long time. 

Suddenly they didn't 
feel anything crawling 
over them. 

They unrolled and 
opened their eyes. 

They were at the 
side of the 
caterpillar pillar. 






"Hi stripe/' said Yellow. 
"Hi Yellow/* said Stripe. 

And they crawled off into 
some fresh, green grass 
to eat and take a nap. 







Just before they fell asleep 
Stripe hugged Yellow. 

"Being together like this a 
sure different from being 
crushed in that crowd!" 



"It sure is!" 



She smiled and closed her 
eyes. 



CHAPTER. 3 




So Yellow and Stripe 
romped in the grass 
and ate 
and grew fat 
and loved each other. 

They were so glad 
not to be fighting 
everybody 
every moment. 




Stripe couldn't help 
wondering, 

"There must be still 
more to life.” 



It was like heaven for a while. 

But as time passed even hugging each 
other seemed a little boring. 

Each know every hair of each other. 










Yellow saw how restless he 
was and tried to make him 
extra happy and 
comfortable. 

"Just think how much 
better this is than that 
awful mess we have left," 
she said. 

"But we don't know what's at 
the top/' he answered. 

"Maybe we were wrong to 
come down. Maybe now that 
we've rested the two of us 
could make it to the top." 




"Dear Stripe, please/' she begged. 

"We can have a nice home and we 
love each other and that's enough. 
It's much more than all those 
lonely climbers have." 

She was so sure. Stripe 
let her convince him. 

But only for awhile 




Stripe's hankering for the climbing 
life worsened. The pillar haunted 
him. He crawled there regularly, 
looking up and wondering. 

But the top remained clouded. 




One day at the pillar, three thuds 
startled Stripe. 

Three big caterpillars had fallen from 
someplace and smashed. 

Two seemed dead but one still 
wiggled. 

Stripe whispered, "What happened?" 
"Can I help?" 

He made out just a few words. 

"The top.... they* 1 1 see.... 

Butterflies alone..." 




The caterpillar died. 







Stripe crawled home and 
told Yellow. 

They were both very sober 
and quite. What did the 
mysterious message mean? 

Had the caterpillars fallen 
from the very top? 



Finally, Stripe announced: 



"I've got to know. I must go and find out the 
secret of the top." 

And more gently, "Will you come and help me?" 

Yellow struggled inside. 

She loved Stripe and wanted to be with him. 
She wanted to help succeed. 



But she just couldn't believe that 

the top was worth all it asks to get there. 
She wanted to get "up" too; the crawling 
life wasn't enough for her either. 

She also had to admit that it looked like 
the pile was the only way to do it.

Stripe seemed to sure that Yellow felt 
ashamed not to agree. She also felt stupid 
and embarrassed since she could never put 
her reasons into words that his kind of logic 
would accept. 

Yet somehow, waiting and not being sure was 
better than action she couldn't believe in. 





She couldn't explain, she couldn't 
prove anything - but for all her love 
she couldn't go with Stripe. 

She just knew climbing was a wrong 
way to get high. 

"No," she said, heartsick. 

And Stripe left her for his climb. 






CHAPTER. 4 



Yellow was desolate without 
Stripe. 




She crawled daily to the pile 
looking for him and returning 
home at night sad, but half 
relieved that she never saw him. 
If she had, she feared she might 
plunge after him knowing that she 
shouldn't. 

She felt like doing something, 
anything, rather that this 
uncertain waiting. 

"What in the world do I really 
want? she sighed. 

"It seems different every few 
minutes." 

"But I know there must be more." 



Finally she became numb and 
wandered away from everything 
familiar. 




One day a grey haired 
caterpillar hanging upside down 
on a branch surprised her. 

He seemed caught in some hairy 
stuff. 

"You seem in trouble/' she said. 
"Can I help?" 

"No, my dear, I have to do this 
to become a butterfly." 

Her whole inside leapt. 
"Butterfly - that word," 
she thought. 

"Tell me Sir, what is a 
butterfly?" 



"It’s what you are meant to become. 

It flies with beautiful wings and joins 
the earth to heaven. 

It drinks only nectar from the flowers 
and carries the seeds to love from one 
flower to another." 

"Without butterflies the world would 
soon have few flowers." 



.jk 






"It can't be true!" 
grasped Yellow. 

"How can I believe 
there’s a butterfly 
inside you or me 
when all I see is 
a fuzzy worm?" 





"How does one become a 
butterfly?" she asked pensively. 

"You must want to fly so much 
that you are willing to give up 
being a caterpillar." 

"You mean to die?" asked Yellow, 
remembering the three who fell 
out of the sky. 

"Yes and No," he answered. 

"What looks like you will die but 
what's really you will still live. 
Life is changed not taken away. 
Isn't that different from those 
who die without ever becoming 
butterflies?" 



"And if I decide to become a 
butterfly/' said Yellow hesitantly. 
"What do I do?" 

"Watch me. I'm making a cocoon. 
"If looks like I'm hiding, I know, 
but a cocoon is no escape. 

"It's an in-between house where 
the change takes place. 

"It's a big step since you can 
never return to caterpillar life. 
"During the change, it will seem 
to you or to anyone who might 
peek that nothing is happening - 
but the butterfly is already 
becoming. 

"It just takes time!" 




"And there's something else! 

"Once you are a butterfly, 
you can really love - the 
kind of love that makes a 
new life. It's better than all 
the hugging caterpillars can 
do." 

"Oh, let me go and get 
Stripe," Yellow said. But she 
sadly knew he was far into 
the pile to possibly reach. 

"Don't be sad," said her new 
friend. "If you change, you 
can fly and show him how 
beautiful butterflies are. 
Maybe he will want to 
become one too!" 





Yellow was torn in anguish: 

"What if Stripe comes back and I'm not 
there? What if he doesn't recognize my 
new self? Suppose he decides to stay a 
caterpillar? 

"At least we can do something as 
caterpillars - we can crawl and eat. 

We can love in some way. 

How can two cocoons get 
together at all? 

How awful to get stuck in a cocoon?" 

How could she risk the only life she 
knew when it seemed so unlikely she 
could ever be a glorious winged 
creature? 



What did she have to go on? 

- Seeing another caterpillar who 
believed enough to make his own 
cocoon. 

- And that peculiar hope which had 
kept her off the pillar and leapt 
within he when she heard about 
butterflies. 



The grey- haired caterpillar 
continued to cover himself with 
silky threads. As he wove the 
last bit around his head he 
called: 

"You'll be a beautiful butterfly 
- we’re all waiting for you!" 






And Yellow decided to risk for a 
butterfly. 

For courage she hung right 
beside the other cocoon and 
began to spin her own. 

For courgae she hung right 
beside the other cocoon and 
began to spin her own. 

"Imagine, I didn't even know I 
could do this. That's some 
encouragement that I'm on the 
right track. If I have inside me 
the stuff to make cocoons - 
maybe the stuff of butterflies is 
there too." 



CHAPTER. S 



Stripe made much faster progress 
this time. He was bigger and 
stronger since he had taken time 
out. From the beginning he 
determined to get to the top. 

He especially avoided meeting the 
eyes of other crawlers. He knew 
how fatal such contact could be. 

He tried not to think of yellow. 

He disciplined himself neither to 
feel nor to be distracted. 





Stripe didn’t seem just "disciplined" 
to others - he seemed ruthless. 

Even among climbers he was special. 

He didn’t think he was against 
anybody. He was just doing what 
he had to if he was to get to the top. 

"Don’t blame me if you 
don’t succeedl It's a 
tough life. Just make 
up your mind/’ he would 
have said had any 
caterpillar complained. 

Then one day 
he was near 
his goal. 






Soon after, he felt tremendous 
pressure and shaking. 

Then came screams and falling 
bodies. 

Then silence; lots more light 
and less weight from above. 



Stripe had done well but when 
light finally filtered down from 
the top, he was close to 
exhaustion. 

At this height there was almost 
no movement. All held their 
positions with every skill a 
lifetime of climbing had taught 
them. Every small move counted 
terribly. 

There was no communication. 
Only the outsides touched. 

They were like cocoons to one 
another. 

Then one day Stripe heard a 
crawler above him saying, 

"None of us can get any higher 
without getting rid of them." 



Stripe felt awful with this new 
knowledge. The mystery of the 
pillar was clear. 

He now knew what had 
happened to the three 
caterpillars. 

He now knew what must always 
happen on the pillar. 

Frustration surged through 
Stripe. But as he was agreeing 
this was the only way "up" he 
heard a tiny whisper from the 
top. 








"There’s nothing here at all!" 
It was answered by another : 




"Quiet fool! They'll hear you down the pillar. We’re where they want to 
get. That’s what’s here!” 



Stripe felt frozen. To be so high and not high at all! 

It only looked good from the bottom. 

The whisper came again, 

"Look over there -another pillar - and there too - everywhere!" 

Stripe became angry as well as frustrated. 

"My pillar/’ he moaned, "only one of thousands." 

"Millions of caterpillars climbing nowhere!" 

"Something is really wrong... 
what else is there?” 




His life with Yellow seemed so far away. 

That wasn’t it either - not quite. 

"Yellow!” He let her image fill his being. 

"You knew something, didn't you? Was it courage to wait?” 

"Maybe she was right. I wish I were with her.” 

"I could go down,” he thought. "I'd look ridiculous but maybe it’s better 
than what’s happening here 




But Stripe's thought was interrupted by 
bursts of movement all over his level. 
Each seemed to be making a last effort 
to find some entry to the top. But with 
every push the top layer tightened. 



Finally one caterpillar gasped /'Unless 
we try together nobody will reach the 
top. Maybe if we give one big pushl 
"They can't hold us down forever!" 

But before they could act there were 
cries and commotion of another kind. 
Stripe struggled to the edge to see the 
cause. 

A brilliant yellow winged creature was 
circling the pillar, moving freely - a 
wonderful sight! How did it get so high 
without climbing? 




When Stripe poked out 
his head the creature 
seemed to recognize him. 
It extended its legs and 
tried to grab him. 

Stripe caught himself just 
before being pulled out of 
the pile. The brilliant 
creature let go and 
looked sadly into his 
eyes. 

That look activated 
excitement Stripe hadn't 
felt since he first saw 
the pillar. Words from 
the past returned, 

%% butterflies alone." 




"Is this a butterfly?" 

And what did it mean - 
"the top they'll see..."? 

It was all so strange and yet 
like it was supposed to be. 
And those eyes with the 
look of Yellow. 

Could it be...? 





Such impossible thoughts! 

Yet the excitement inside 
wouldn't stop. 

He grew happy. 

Somehow he could escape, 
he could be carried away. 

But as this possibility became real, 
something else grew inside. 

He felt he shouldn't escape like this. 





Looking into the creature’s eyes 
he could hardly bear the love he 
saw there. He felt unworthy. 

He wanted to change, to make 
up for all the times he had 
refused to look at the other. 

He tried to tell her 
what he felt. 

He stopped struggling. 

The others stared at him 
as though he were mad. 



CHAPTER. 6 



He turned around and began down 
the pillar. This time he didn't curl up. 
He stretched out full length and 
looked straight into the eyes of 
each caterpillar. 

He marveled at the variety and 
beauty, amazed that he had never 
noticed it before. 

He whispered to each, "I've been up; 
there's nothing there." 

Most paid no attention; they were too 
intent on climbing. 

One said, "Its sour grapes. 

He’s bitter. I bet he never made 
it to the top." 





But some were 
shocked and even 
stopped climbing to 
hear him better. 

One of these 
whispered in anguish, 
"Don’t say it even if 
it’s true. What else 
can we do?” 



Stripe's answer shocked 
them all - including himself! 

"We can fly! 

"We can become butterflies! 
"There's nothing at the top 
and it doesn't matter!” 

As he heard his own 
message he realized how 
he had misread the instinct 
to get high. 

To get to the "top” he 
must fly, not climb. 

Stripe looked at each 
caterpillar inebriated 
with joy that there could 
be a butterfly inside. 





But the reaction was worse 
than before. He saw fear in 
eyes. They didn't stop to 
listen or speak. 

This happy, glorious news, 
was too much to take - too 
good to be true. 

And if it wasn't true? 

The hope that lit up the 
pillar dimmed. All seemed 
confused and unreal. 

The way down was so 
immensely long. 

The vision of the butterfly 
faded. 



Doubts flooded Stripe, 

The pile took on horrible 
dimensions. 

He struggled on - barely - 
blindly. 

He seemed wrong to give up 
believing seemed impossible. 

A crawler sneered, "How could 
you swallow such a story? 

Our life is earth and climbing. 
Look at us worms! We couldn’t 
be butterflies inside. Make 
the best of it and enjoy 
caterpillar living!" 

"Perhaps he’s right," sighed 
Stripe. "I haven't any proof. 
Did I only make it up because 
I needed it so much?" 







And in pain he continued 
down searching for those 
eyes which would let him 
whisper. 

"I saw a butterfly - there 
can be more to life." 



One - day - 
finally - 

He was down. 






CHAPTER. 7 




Tired and sad. Stripe 
crawled off to the old 
place where Yellow and he 
had romped. 

She was not there and he 
was too exhausted to go 
further. 

He curled up and fell 
asleep. 




When he finally awoke 
he found the yellow 
creature fanning him 
with wings of light. 

"Is this a dream?" 
he wondered. 




But the dream creature acted 
awfully real. She stroked him with 
her feelers and most of all looked 
at him so lovingly that he began to 
trust that what he had said about 
becoming a butterfly might be true. 

She walked a little distance away, 
then flew back. She repeated it as 
if he should follow. 

So he did. 





They came to a 
branch from 
which hung two 
torn sacks. 

The creature 
kept on inserting 
her head, then 
her tail, into 
one of them. 

Then she would 
fly to him and 
touch him. 






Her feelers quivered 
and Stripe knew she 
was speaking. 

He couldn't make out 
words. 

Then slowly he seemed 
to understand 





....Somehow he knew what to do. 



Stripe climbed - again. 



It got darker and darker 
and he was afraid. 

He felt he had to let go of 

everything... 






THE END
